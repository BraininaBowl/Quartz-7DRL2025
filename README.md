You find a package on your doorstep. It contains a strange device, and a note that reads:

"If you read this, there's still time. Tonight, Weyuani Corp will use their prototype Quartz device to travel back in time and ruin life for all of us. Take this device, use it to infiltrate their headquarters, steal the prototype and send it back in time to yourself to thwart their plans. If this doesn't make any sense, **don't think to much about it**."

The goal of the game is to clear every level, which makes you proceed to the next one. On level 8 you can nab the Quartz device and win the game.

At the beginning of every turn you gain 0.5 PHASE charge. With the E button (on your keyboard or the device) you can either teleport to another place on the level (using one charge) or go back in time (using one charge per turn). When you go back in time, you can perform one action in that turn before being returned to your native time.
